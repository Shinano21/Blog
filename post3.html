                        <p class="text-muted">This week, Superduper was our team's focus in reviewing student proposals for off-campus and on-campus events. We started by reviewing stacks of proposal papers carefully, ensuring each contained the basics clear goals, complete plans, and the right approvals. A couple of proposals were submitted lacking important details we sent it back to the students, but we collaborated with the students to have all sorted by the end of the week. With the proposals done and signed off, we went on to entering the details into our system, capturing the spirit if where is the document going with accuracy and no mistakes, thanks to our diligent double-checks. The last step was the delivery: some forms were shipped out to VPAA and off-campus VPAA. The only snag was those very first incomplete submissions, which is leading us to wonder about whether a student-oriented checklist would make it even simpler.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">The life in our office is hectic with documents pouring in, and we're the ones keeping it all straight with a smile. Our new web-based record tracker is our go-to sidekick, making our job of monitoring incoming documents appear easier. We're careful to document each document properly, double-checking for errors. The web-based system tracker, is the way it allows us to checkmark whether a document's status is "returned," "pending," or "forwarded," all with a few notations, keeping everything straight. Sending documents to the right people—whether it's a coworker down the hall or a client across town—seems easier now, with the tracker providing real-time updates so nothing gets misplaced. This Web-based is user-friendly, too. It's so simple to operate that it seems to get us. It has cut down on the paper clutter and let us get on with what we enjoy: staying organized and getting ahead. We can't wait to see how it's improving our workdays and I can't wait to share more blogs soon!</p>

                        <h2>Week 3</h2>
                        <p class="text-muted">In our office was a whirlwind of student activity documents, and our team’s been diving in with all we’ve got, keeping the energy up even as the papers pile high. These documents are all about student NSTP day checking hundreds of students if the parents signed the permit or not, each one buzzing with the excitement of campus activities. We’re carefully logging every detail by hand in our record books, noting each document gets a status mark: returned if it’s been processed and sent back to the student or club, pending if it’s waiting for approval, or forwarded if it’s been passed to Dean’s office or other offices. With the stacks growing taller this week, we’re double-checking every form to ensure names are correct, dates match, and no boxes are left unchecked. Delivering these papers required a muscle work whether it’s dropping them off at the Dean’s office or handing them to the student council office feels like passing along a piece of student spirit. The flood of forms has been intense, but it’s brought our team closer, laughing and hustling together to keep everything organized and moving. We’re tired but pumped, and we can’t wait to share more next week!</p>

                <!-- April Week 4 -->
                <section class="post">

                        <h2>Week 4</h2>
                        <p class="text-muted">in our office brought a welcome breather, with the flood of student activity documents tapering to a trickle, and our team able to catch our breath and luxuriate in the peace. The incoming papers its either student activities or off-campus activity are now a handful. We're recording every detail by hand in our record books, painstakingly noting student names, activity dates, and event types to keep it all in check. Each document gets its status marked: returned if it's been processed and returned to a student or to a faculty staff if it's awaiting approval, or forwarded if it's been passed on to the Dean’s office. We're still double-checking every form, ensuring names, dates, parents signature and details are on-point, even with fewer papers to sort through. Handing over these documents whether it's a quick drop-off at the Dean’s office or passing them along to the another offices feels satisfying, knowing we're keeping the student energy alive. This week, though, was bittersweet as we said goodbye to one of our clerical staff, whose contract ended. We laughed, reminisced, and gave him a warm send-off, lightened by the news that he's already landed himself a new job. The slower pace and this goodbye have left us wistful but grateful, and we're eager to share more of our adventure next week!</p>
